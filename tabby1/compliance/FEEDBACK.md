# Feedback from CDC

* The need for an overall document to accompany the tool laying out the 
objectives of the tool and with full description of the scenarios (AH: along the
lines of those descriptions you sent, Nick). Maybe a repeat of the manuscript 
abstract. (AH: I realize that this will be linked to the MS when published.)

* Provide links to the underlying calibration graphs so users can see how well
historic trends have been captured. Fits in with previous comment. (AH: I think
this is a really important point as it will reassure users that projections are
based  on real data.)

* Include HIV as it’s in the existing model.

* Maintain user friendliness and not get bogged down with too many tabs.(AH: A
bit generic, I’m just passing it on.)

* I like the “take the tour” idea except it covers the last part of the graph.
Moving it in the bottom center or someplace where it doesn’t mess with the
figure would be better.

* An additional intervention scenario to consider (don’t know if there is data
or not – could ARPE data work) – “Better contact investigations” which would
impact case detection and intervening transmission.

* What does that network diagram do? (AH: this refers to the PPML logo at top
left! Need to be clear what that is.)

* Incidence is typically reported as cases per 100K (not per million). LTBI
prevalence is reported as % (not per million). (AH: this was the source of 
confusion over the y-axis labels I briefly alluded to on the call; I see now 
there is nothing wrong with the existing axis but these are the metrics in which
many TB people think, despite the fact that the elimination target is per 
million. I think it’s worth changing. The LTBI graph mentioned came up as an age
group projection with interventions in US-born.)
