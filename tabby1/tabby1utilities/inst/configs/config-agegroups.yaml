  descriptions:

    intervention_2: Intensification of the current LTBI targeted testing and treatment policy for
      high-risk populations, doubling treatment uptake within each risk group compared
      to current levels, and increasing the fraction cured among individuals initiating
      LTBI treatment, via a 3-month Isoniazid-Rifapentine drug regimen
    intervention_3: Improved detection of TB cases, such that the duration of untreated
      disease (time from TB incidence to the initiation of treatment) is reduced by 50%
    intervention_4: Improved treatment quality for TB, such that treatment default, failure
      rates, and the fraction of individuals receiving an incorrect drug regimen are
      reduced by 50% from current levels
