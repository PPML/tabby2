  descriptions:
    intervention_1: Provision of LTBI testing and treatment for all new legal
      immigrants entering the US
    intervention_2: Intensification of the current LTBI targeted testing and
      treatment policy for high-risk populations, doubling treatment uptake within
      each risk group compared to current levels, and increasing the fraction cured
      among individuals initiating LTBI treatment, via a 3-month Isoniazid-Rifapentine
      drug regimen
    intervention_3: Improved detection of TB cases, such that the duration
      of untreated disease (time from TB incidence to the initiation of
      treatment) is reduced by 50%
    intervention_4: Improved treatment quality for TB, such that treatment default,
      failure rates, and the fraction of individuals receiving an incorrect drug
      regimen are reduced by 50% from current levels
    intervention_5: The combination of all intervention scenarios described above

  descriptions:
    scenario_1: From 2020 onwards, no individuals acquire M. TB infection from transmission within
      the United States. In this scenario the only source of new LTBI cases is from
      existing infection in new immigrants.
    scenario_2: From 2020 onwards, all individuals immigrating to the United States are free of
      M. TB infection, while maintaining the same total volume of immigration.
