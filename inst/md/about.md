Tabby2 is a web application providing predictions of future TB epidemiology in
the United States under a wide range of policy scenarios. The application
includes several pre-defined scenarios, which explore various changes in the
active and latent TB diagnosis cascade, as well as the functionality for users
to define custom scenarios, such as targeted testing and treatment of high-risk
populations and changes to baseline TB control programs. After exploring or
creating scenarios, users can select a health outcome and subpopulation of
interest, to compare the results of one or more of these scenarios. Results are
displayed graphically, and following inputs from the user the graphs update
automatically to reflect the new selections. Visualizations can be downloaded
in various formats, and the estimates underlying the graphs can also be
downloaded in tabular format.

The estimates shown by Tabby2 are based on an expansion of a published
transmission-dynamic model of TB epidemiology in the US, which incorporates TB
transmission and natural history; TB drug resistance patterns; prior and future
TB prevention and control; the impact of HIV on TB; heterogeneity in TB risks
among US-born and foreign-born populations; and age-based differences in
disease mechanisms and risk factor prevalence. The detailed methods (analytic
methods, scenario and outcome definitions) and main results for this published
analysis are described in detail in “Prospects for tuberculosis elimination in
the United States: results of a transmission dynamic model”; an upcoming
publication on the model expansion is expected and will be posted here as soon
as it is available.
