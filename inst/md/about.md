Tabby2 is a web application that provides projections of future tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology in the United States under a range of TB and LTBI testing and treatment scenarios that can be chosen by the user. The application includes several predefined scenarios, which explore changes in the care cascades for TB disease and latent TB infection (LTBI). The application also allows users to define new scenarios, which can project the impact of greater targeted testing and treatment of high-risk populations, or changes to the performance of current TB control programs. After specifying scenarios, users can select a health outcome and subpopulation of interest, and then view results of one or more of the scenarios they have specified. Results are displayed graphically, and these graphs can be adjusted based on user input to include additional results or focus on particular population subgroups. Visualizations can be downloaded in various formats, and the estimates underlying the graphs can also be downloaded in tabular format.

The estimates shown by Tabby2 are based on a mathematical model of TB epidemiology in the United States, which incorporates TB transmission and natural history; prior and future TB prevention and control; heterogeneity in TB risks among U.S.-born and non-U.S.–born populations; and age-based differences in disease mechanisms and risk factor prevalence. 
 
This model has been fit to local data from all fifty states and District of Columbia. 

The model has also been fit to aggregate data for the United States to allow national-level analyses. These analyses expand on an earlier study on future TB epidemiology in the United States (Menzies et al 2018. “Prospects for tuberculosis elimination in the United States: results of a transmission dynamic model” Am J Epid 187(9):2011-2020) (https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/187/9/2011/4995883)).  

This modeling effort was funded by the CDC, National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention Epidemiologic and Economic Modeling Agreement (NEEMA, # 5U38PS004644-01, #1NU38PS004651-01).
