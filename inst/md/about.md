Tabby2 is a web application that provides predictions of future TB
epidemiology in the United States under a range of policy scenarios that
can be chosen by the user. The application includes several predefined
scenarios, which explore changes in the care cascades for active TB
disease and latent TB infection. The application also allows users to
define new scenarios, which can project the impact of greater targeted
testing and treatment of high-risk populations, or changes to the
performance of current TB control programs. After specifying scenarios,
users can select a health outcome and subpopulation of interest, and
then view results of one or more of the scenarios they have specified.
Results are displayed graphically, and these graphs can be adjusted
based on user input to include additional results or focus on particular
population subgroups. Visualizations can be downloaded in various
formats, and the estimates underlying the graphs can also be downloaded
in tabular format.

The estimates shown by Tabby2 are based on a mathematical model of TB
epidemiology in the United States, which incorporates TB transmission
and natural history; prior and future TB prevention and control;
heterogeneity in TB risks among U.S.-born and non-U.S.-born populations;
and age-based differences in disease mechanisms and risk factor
prevalence. These analyses expand on an earlier study on future TB
epidemiology in the United States (Menzies et al 2018. "Prospects for
tuberculosis elimination in the United States: results of a transmission
dynamic model" J Epid 187(9):2011-2020)
(<https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/187/9/2011/4995883>)).

This research was funded by the CDC, National Center for HIV, Viral
Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention Epidemiologic and Economic Modeling
Agreement (NEEMA, \# 5U38PS004644-01).
