Custom Intervention Scenarios
===

Custom interventions allow users to simulate elevated screening
rate scenarios on specific subpopulations within the model.

Subpopulations can be specified by their age groups, nativity status, and their
risk group. Risk groups can be chosen from a list of prespecified risk groups or
defined by the user in terms of LTBI progression risk and mortality risk relative
to the total population.
