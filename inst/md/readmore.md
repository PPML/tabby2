# Organization of the tool

Tabby2 has as its major components an Introduction, Scenarios, Outcomes, 
Downloads, and Further Description. 

## Scenarios

Scenarios include three types:
- Targeted LTBI Testing and Treatment
- Pre-built Scenarios
- TLTBI Regimen Changes

In the Targeted LTBI Testing and Treatment scenario we allow users
to simulate scenarios where the amount of LTBI treatment is increased
by screening specific populations.

Predefined scenarios modify the base case in the following specified ways:

**Modeled Scenarios**

-   **TLTBI for New Immigrants:** Provision of LTBI testing and treatment
    for all new legal immigrants entering the United States.
-   **Improved TLTBI in the United States:** Intensification of the
    current LTBI targeted testing and treatment policy for high-risk
    populations, doubling treatment uptake within each risk group
    compared to current levels, and increasing the fraction cured among
    individuals initiating LTBI treatment, via a 3-month
    Isoniazid-Rifapentine drug regimen.
-   **Better Case Detection:** Improved detection of active TB cases, such
    that the duration of untreated active disease (time from TB
    incidence to the initiation of treatment) is reduced by 50%.
-   **Better TB Treatment:** Improved treatment quality for active TB,
    such that treatment default, failure rates, and the fraction of
    individuals receiving an incorrect drug regimen are reduced by 50%
    from current levels.
-   **All Improvements:** The combination of all intervention scenarios
    described above.

## Outcomes

Outcomes are presented as three interactive pages with visualizations:
Estimates, Time Trends, Age Groups.

The *Estimates* page visualizes predicted TB outcomes at five major time
points: 2016, 2025, 2050, 2075, and 2100.

The *Time Trends* page depicts predicted TB outcomes for each individual
year from 2016 to 2100.

The *Age Groups* page visualizes predicted TB outcomes for a specified
year subdivided into 11 age groups.

#### Estimates page

User options are shown in a column on the left. The user specifies:

*Comparison:* results can be shown as absolute values for each outcome
in each year, as a percentage of the base case scenario in the same
year, or as a percentage of the base case scenario in 2016.

*Subgroup:* results can be shown for the total population, or for a
subgroup described by nativity (U.S.-born, non-U.S.-born), and broad age
groups (0-24 years, 25-64 years, 65+ years).

*Outcome:* results can be shown for five different outcomes:

-   **Incident TB Infections** representing the annual number of
    incident *M. tb (Mycobacterium tuberculosis)* infections per million
    due to transmission within the United States (includes reinfection of
    individuals with LTBI, excludes migrants entering the United States with
    established LTBI);
-   **LTBI Prevalence** representing the percentage of individuals with
    latent TB infection in a given year;
-   **Active TB Incidence** representing the annual number of notified TB
    cases per million, including TB cases identified after death;
-   **MDR-TB in Incident TB Cases** representing the percentage of all
    incident TB cases with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB); and
-   **TB-Related Deaths** representing annual TB-attributable mortality
    per million.

*Scenarios:* results can be shown for up to five scenarios selected by
the user, describing hypothetical changes to current TB prevention and
control activities (‘Modeled Scenarios'). Descriptions for
each scenario are provided below.

*Download:* clicking on a button initiates download of the visualization
itself (.png, .pdf, .pptx) or the estimates underlying the visualization
(.csv, .xlsx).


#### Time Trends page

User options are shown in a column on the left. The user specifies:

*Comparison:* results can be shown as absolute values for each outcome
in each year, as a percentage of the base case scenario in the same
year, or as a percentage of the base case scenario in 2016.

*Subgroup:* results can be shown for the total population, or for a
subgroup described by nativity (U.S.-born, non-U.S.-born), and broad age
groups (0-24 years, 25-64 years, 65+ years).

*Outcome:* results can be shown for five different outcomes:

-   **Incident TB infections** representing the annual number of
    incident *M. tb (Mycobacterium tuberculosis)* infections per million
    due to transmission within the United States (includes reinfection of
    individuals with prior infection, excludes migrants entering the
    United States with established LTBI);
-   **LTBI Prevalence** representing the percentage of individuals with
    latent TB infection in a given year;
-   **Active TB Incidence** representing the annual number of notified TB
    cases per million, including TB cases identified after death;
-   **MDR-TB in incident TB cases** representing the percentage of all
    incident TB cases with MDR-TB; and
-   **TB-Related Deaths** representing annual TB-attributable mortality
    per million.

*Scenarios:* results can be shown for up to five scenarios selected by
the user, describing different assumptions about future TB prevention
and control policy (‘Modeled Scenarios'). Descriptions for
each scenario are provided below.

*Download:* clicking on a button initiates download of the visualization
itself (.png, .pdf, .pptx) or the estimates underlying the visualization
(.csv, .xlsx).

#### Age Groups page

This page matches the format of the first two pages with the following
exceptions:

*Comparison:* results are only shown as absolute values for each outcome
in each year.

*Subgroup:* results can be shown for the total population, or for
U.S.-born and non-U.S.-born alone.

*Outcomes:* results can be shown for three major outcomes (LTBI
prevalence, TB incidence, and TB-related deaths), either as a prevalence
or incidence rate with each age group (first three selections), or in
absolute numbers (last three selections).

The following are descriptions of the intervention scenarios and
outcomes available for visualization in Tabby.


# Definitions and Abbreviations

#### **Base Case**

The base case is the default scenario, assuming no change in current TB
prevention and control activities. This scenario is automatically
included in all visualizations, and other scenarios are defined and
analyzed with reference to this scenario.

#### **Uncertainty Intervals**

Uncertainty intervals are used to express the degree of uncertainty
associated with a statistic. Where the intervals are wider, this means
that there is greater uncertainty about the true value of the statistic.
For the uncertainty intervals shown in the visualizations, there is a
2.5% probability (a one-in-forty chance) that the true value is above
the upper end of the interval, and a 2.5% probability that the true
value is below the lower end of the interval.

#### **Dynamic Transmission Model**

Dynamic transmission models are systems of mathematical equations
designed to reproduce the epidemiology of communicable diseases. These
analyses assume that improvements in disease control (such as more rapid
                                                      diagnosis and treatment of infectious individuals) will reduce the risk
that uninfected individuals will be exposed to infection. In this
manner, individuals not directly reached by an intervention may still
benefit by experiencing a lower risk of infection.

#### **Incident Cases**

Incident cases are new disease cases. Incidence refers to the number of
new cases that develop in a particular population in a given period of
time.

#### **Isoniazid (INH)**

A medicine used to prevent TB disease in people who have latent TB
infection. INH is also one of the four medicines often used to treat TB
disease.

#### **LTBI – Latent tuberculosis infection**

A condition in which TB bacteria are alive, but inactive in the body.
People with latent TB infection have no symptoms, don’t feel sick, can’t
spread TB to others, and usually have a positive TB skin test or
positive TB blood test reaction. However, they may develop TB disease if
they do not receive treatment for latent TB infection.

#### **MDR-TB – Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis**

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis includes strains of TB that are
resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, two common and potent TB drugs.

#### **Prevalence**

The number of cases of a disease present in a population at a given
time.

#### **Rifapentine (RPT)**

A medication used to treat latent TB infection.

#### **TLTBI**
Treatment and testing for latent tuberculosis infection

#### **TB – Tuberculosis**

A disease caused by bacteria that are spread from person to person
through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect
other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine.
In most cases, TB is treatable and curable; however, people with TB can
die if they do not get proper treatment.
