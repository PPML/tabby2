Tabby2 provides estimates of future TB outcomes for a small number of
predefined scenarios, in addition to a base case scenario that assumes
continuation of current TB policy and services. The tool's predefined
scenarios include 5 hypothetical scenarios that reflect a range of
changes to latent TB and TB disease testing and treatment, described below.

-   **TLTBI for New Immigrants**: Provision of LTBI testing and
    treatment for all new legal immigrants entering the US.

-   **Improved TLTBI in the United States**: Intensification of the
    current LTBI targeted testing and treatment policy for high-risk
    populations, doubling treatment uptake within each risk group
    compared to current levels, and increasing the fraction cured among
    individuals initiating LTBI treatment, via a 3-month
    Isoniazid-Rifapentine drug regimen.

-   **Enhanced Case Detection**: Improved detection of TB cases, such that
    the duration of untreated disease (time from when person became
    infectious to the initiation of treatment) is reduced by 50%.

-   **Enhanced TB Treatment**: Improved treatment quality for TB disease,
    such that treatment default, failure rates, and the fraction of
    individuals receiving an incorrect drug regimen are reduced by 50%
    from current levels.

-   **All Improvements**: The combination of all intervention scenarios
    described above.

Each of these scenarios is automatically available when the user chooses
scenarios to plot.

After the user reviews the descriptions of the predefined scenarios,
they can either proceed to one of the *Outcomes* pages to view the
results corresponding to these predefined scenarios, or choose to define
a new scenario by navigating to the *Custom Scenarios* page.
