Tabby2 provides estimates of future TB outcomes for a small number of
predefined scenarios, in addition to a base case scenario that assumes
continuation of current TB policy and services. The tool's predefined
scenarios include 5 hypothetical scenarios that reflect a range of
changes to latent TB and TB disease testing and treatment, described below.

-   **LTBI treatment for new migrants**: Provision of LTBI testing and
    treatment for all new legal migrants entering the US.

-   **Improved LTBI treatment in the United States**: Intensification of the
    current LTBI targeted testing and treatment efforts for high-risk
    populations, doubling treatment uptake within each risk group
    compared to current levels, and increasing the percentage cured among
    individuals initiating LTBI treatment, via a 3-month
    Isoniazid-Rifapentine drug regimen.

-   **Enhanced case detection**: Improved detection of TB disease cases,
    such that the duration of untreated disease (time from TB
    incidence to the initiation of treatment) is reduced by 50%.

-   **Enhanced TB treatment**: Improved treatment quality for TB disease,
    such that treatment default, failure rates, and the percentage of
    individuals receiving an incorrect drug regimen are reduced by 50%
    from current levels.

-   **All improvements**: The combination of all changes described in other
    predefined scenarios.

Each of these scenarios is automatically available when the user chooses
scenarios to plot.

After the user reviews the descriptions of the predefined scenarios,
they can either proceed to one of the *Modelled Outcomes* pages to view the
results corresponding to these predefined scenarios, or choose to define
a new scenario by navigating to the *Custom Scenarios* page.
