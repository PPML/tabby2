Tabby2 not only predicts the trajectory of TB given the current conditions of
testing and treatment, but also can make hypothetical predictions that are the
result of changes to testing and treatment in the future. Our Predefined Scenarios
include 5 hypothetical scenarios which model changes to TB testing and
treatment. These are options available for visualization in the Outcomes pages,
selectable as Model Scenarios.

-   **TLTBI for New Immigrants**: Provision of LTBI testing and treatment
for all new legal immigrants entering the US.
- **Improved TLTBI in the United States**: Intensification of the
current LTBI targeted testing and treatment policy for high-risk
populations, doubling treatment uptake within each risk group
compared to current levels, and increasing the fraction cured among
individuals initiating LTBI treatment, via a 3-month
Isoniazid-Rifapentine drug regimen.
- **Better Case Detection**: Improved detection of active TB cases, such
that the duration of untreated active disease (time from TB
incidence to the initiation of treatment) is reduced by 50%.
- **Better TB Treatment**: Improved treatment quality for active TB,
such that treatment default, failure rates, and the fraction of
individuals receiving an incorrect drug regimen are reduced by 50%
from current levels.
- **All Improvements**: The combination of all intervention scenarios
described above.

If these satisfy your modeling needs, you can proceed to the Outcomes pages
and view the predicted outcomes corresponding to these Predefined Scenarios. 
If you would like to model a scenario not listed here 
comprised of hypothetical Targeted Testing and Treatment interventions and
Program Changes, then proceed to Build Scenarios.
