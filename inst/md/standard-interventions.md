# Standard Intervention Scenarios

-   **TLTBI for New Immigrants**: Provision of LTBI testing and treatment
for all new legal immigrants entering the US.
- **Improved TLTBI in the United States**: Intensification of the
current LTBI targeted testing and treatment policy for high-risk
populations, doubling treatment uptake within each risk group
compared to current levels, and increasing the fraction cured among
individuals initiating LTBI treatment, via a 3-month
Isoniazid-Rifapentine drug regimen.
- **Better Case Detection**: Improved detection of active TB cases, such
that the duration of untreated active disease (time from TB
                                               incidence to the initiation of treatment) is reduced by 50%.
- **Better TB Treatment**: Improved treatment quality for active TB,
such that treatment default, failure rates, and the fraction of
individuals receiving an incorrect drug regimen are reduced by 50%
from current levels.
- **All Improvements**: The combination of all intervention scenarios
described above.

### Additional Scenarios

- **No Transmission Within the United States after 2016**: From 2016
onwards, no individuals acquire *M. tb* infection from transmission
within the United States. In this scenario the only source of new
LTBI cases is from existing infection in new migrants entering the
country.
- **No LTBI Among Immigrants after 2016**: From 2016 onwards, all
individuals immigrating to the United States are free of *M. tb*
  infection, while maintaining the same total volume of immigration.
